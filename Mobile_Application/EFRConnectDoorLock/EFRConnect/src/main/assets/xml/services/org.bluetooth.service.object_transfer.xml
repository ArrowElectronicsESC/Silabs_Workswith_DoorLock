        <Abstract>
            This service provides management and control features supporting bulk data transfers
            which occur via a separate L2CAP connection oriented channel. The Client is enabled to
            create and delete objects and to execute an action using the currently selected object.
            The selected object can be written, updated or read via an Object Transfer Channel
            opened by the Client. The generation of a checksum covering a part or the whole of the
            object contents is included as an optional feature. This service provides a general
            method for a Client to select and initiate the transfer of any type of object.

        value that may exceed (ATT_MTU-3) octets in length, where ATT_MTU is the default size for
        the transport being used, and the characteristic is writable; optional otherwise.
